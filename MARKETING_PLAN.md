## Recommended Strategy: Hybrid Approach

### Phase 1: Organic TikTok (Free - Start Immediately)

Build audience organically before spending on ads.

**Why TikTok Organic First:**
- Zero cost to start
- Algorithm favors new accounts with engaging content
- Wedding content performs exceptionally well
- User-generated content is 2.4× more authentic than brand content
- Completion rate matters more than followers

**Content Strategy:**
1. **Educational content** (2-3x/week)
   - "3 things guests wish they could do at weddings"
   - "How to collect all your wedding photos in one place"
   - "Why you'll lose 80% of your wedding photos" (problem-aware)

2. **Trending sounds & formats**
   - Use trending audio with wedding-related visuals
   - Before/after transformations (scattered photos → organized gallery)
   - "POV: You're a bride who..." format

3. **Behind-the-scenes**
   - Product demos showing the platform
   - Setting up a wedding gallery in 2 minutes

### Phase 2: Paid Advertising (€50-100 budget)

**Recommended Split:**

| Platform | Budget | Expected Clicks | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------------|-----------|
| Meta Ads France | €40 | 40-80 clicks | Best targeting for engaged couples |
| Meta Ads USA | €30 | 15-20 clicks | Higher CPC but larger market |
| TikTok Spark Ads | €30 | 40-175 clicks | Boost best organic content |

### Meta Ads Strategy

**Targeting (France):**
- Age: 24-40
- Relationship: Engaged
- Interests: Wedding planning, Wedding photography, Mariage
- Behaviors: Recently engaged (6 months)

**Targeting (USA):**

**Keywords/Copy (English):**
- "Collect all your wedding photos in one place"
- "Collaborative wedding photo gallery"
- "Share your wedding memories"
- "Custom wedding website"

### TikTok Ads Strategy

**Important Budget Note:**
TikTok requires **minimum $50/day** at campaign level and **$20/day** at ad group level. This means:
- Minimum test: $50/day × 3 days = $150 minimum
- **Recommendation:** Start with organic content, then use **Spark Ads** to boost your best-performing organic videos (lower cost, better performance)

**Spark Ads Approach (Recommended for small budget):**
- Create organic content first
- Identify videos with good engagement (>5% completion rate)
- Boost as Spark Ads with $20-30 budget
- Target: Engaged couples, wedding interests, 24-35 age

**TikTok Ad Costs (2025):**
